Easy tool kit is a program designed for users of screen readers
It contains various tools such as currency converter, random draw, wikipedia search, nvda add-on downloader, etc.
This program is built using the wxpython graphical interface.
In fact, this project was my first actual project after learning python.
So some of the code might be a bit messy.
I don't know if I'll update the software again, let's let that time decide.
My goal in publishing the source for this program is for python learners to learn some ideas or ways to write some code.
When I forget a few things I go back to this source, because I almost put a lot of code in it and I think it's kind of enough for me to remember what I want with it.
Please do not message me for the purpose of solving a problem, in this source, but if you want to contact me to ask me about an idea for a code, or a way to solve a problem in general in python, or anyhelp you are welcome.
I allow anyone to take, modify and publish any code from this source, without asking me.
