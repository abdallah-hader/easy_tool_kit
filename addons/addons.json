 "Ignore Blanks Indentation Reporting": [
  "2021.1 and beyond",
  "This is an NVDA addon that alters the reporting of indentation by disregarding blank lines when deciding whether to report changes in indentation. It is best understood by contrasting with normal behaviour with an example.\nConsider this example:\ndef foo():\n    x = 42\n\n    return x\n\ndef bar():\nThe current behaviour of NVDA is to report indentation changes for any line where the indentation has changed, even if the line is blank. So, the example would be read like:\ndef foo():\ntab x = 42\nno indent blank\ntab return x\nno indent blank\ndef bar():\nThe disadvantage for this behaviour is that for most programming languages, like python, a blank line has no semantic significance and is just used to visually separate lines of code with no change to the code's meaning. Therefore, by reporting the change of indentation upon entering a blank line and then reporting it again after landing on the next line is just noise that makes it harder to focus on understanding the code.\nThis addon aims to improve on the behaviour by ignoring blank lines when computing indentation speech, thus the example is read like this instead:\ndef foo():\ntab x = 42\nblank\nreturn x\n\nno indent def bar():",

 "Windows Magnifier": [
  "2018.3 and beyond",
  "This add-on improves the use of Windows Magnifier with NVDA.\nFeatures\n\u2022 Allows to report the result of some native Magnifier keyboard commands.\n\u2022 Allows to reduce the cases where table navigation commands conflict with Magnifier's commands.\n\u2022 Adds some keyboard shortcuts to toggle various Magnifier options.\nSettings\nThe setting panel of Windows Magnifier add-on allows to configure how NVDA reacts to native Windows Magnifier commands. You may want to have more or less commands reported according to what you are able to see. This panel may be opened choosing Preferences -> Settings in the NVDA menu and then selecting the Windows Magnifier category in the Settings window. The keyboard shortcut NVDA+Windows+O then O also allows to open this settings panel directly.\nThe panel contains the following options:\n\u2022 \nReport view moves: controls what is reported when you move the view with Control+Alt+Arrows commands. The three options are:\n\u2022 Off: Nothing is reported.\n\u2022 With speech: a speech message indicates the position of the zoomed view on the dimension the view is being moved.\n\u2022 With tones: a tone is played and its pitch indicates the position of the zoomed view on the dimension the view is being moved.\nThis option only affects full view mode.\n\u2022 \nReport turn on or off: If checked, the Magnifier's state is reported when you use Windows++ or Windows+Escape commands to turn it on or off.\n\u2022 Report zoom: If checked, the Magnifier's zoom level is reported when you use Windows++ or Windows+- zoom commands.\n\u2022 Report color inversion: If checked, the color inversion state is reported when you use the control+Alt+I toggle command.\n\u2022 Report view change: If checked, the view type is reported when you use a command that changes the view type (Control+Alt+M, Control+Alt+F, Control+Alt+D, Control+Alt+L)\n\u2022 Report lens or docked window resizing: If checked, a message is reported when you use the resizing commands (Alt+Shift+Arrows). In docked window mode, the height or the width is reported. In lens mode, the new dimension cannot be reported for now. These resizing command do not seem to be available on all versions of Windows; if your Windows version does not support them, you should keep this option unchecked.\n\u2022 \nIn documents and list views, pass control+alt+arrows shortcuts to Windows Magnifier: There are three possible choices:\n\u2022 Never: The command is not passed to Windows Magnifier and standard NVDA table navigation can operate. When used in documents out of a table, the Control+Alt+Arrow command reports a \"Not in a table\" error message. This is the standard behaviour of NVDA without this add-on.\n\u2022 Only when not in table: In table or in list views, Control+Alt+Arrow commands perform standard table navigation. When used in documents out of a table, Control+Alt+Arrow commands perform standard Magnifier view move commands. If you still want to move Windows Magnifier view while in table or in list view, you will need to press NVDA+F2 before using Control+Alt+Arrow commands. This option is the best compromise if you want to use Control+Alt+Arrow for both Magnifier and table navigation.\n\u2022 Always: Control+Alt+Arrow commands moves the Magnifier's view in any case. This option may be useful if you do not use Control+Alt+Arrow to navigate in table, e.g. because you have changed table navigation shortcuts in NVDA or because you exclusively use Easy table navigator add-on for table navigation.\nCommands added by this add-on\nIn addition to native Magnifier commands, this add-on provide additional commands that allow to control Magnifier's options without opening its configuration page. All the commands added to control Magnifier options are accessible through the Magnifier layer command NVDA+Windows+O:\n\u2022 NVDA+Windows+O then C: Toggles on or off caret tracking.\n\u2022 NVDA+Windows+O then F: Toggles on or off focus tracking.\n\u2022 NVDA+Windows+O then M: Toggles on or off mouse tracking.\n\u2022 NVDA+Windows+O then T: Toggles on or off tracking globally.\n\u2022 NVDA+Windows+O then S: Toggles on or off smoothing.\n\u2022 NVDA+Windows+O then R: Switches between mouse tracking modes (within the edge of the screen or centered on the screen); this feature is only available on Windows 10 build 17643 or higher.\n\u2022 NVDA+Windows+O then X: Switches between text cursor tracking modes (within the edge of the screen or centered on the screen); this feature is only available on Windows 10 build 18894 or higher.\n\u2022 NVDA+Windows+O then V: Moves the mouse cursor in the center of the magnified view (command available in full screen view only).\n\u2022 NVDA+Windows+O then O: Opens Windows Magnifier add-on settings.\n\u2022 NVDA+Windows+O then H: Displays help on Magnifier layer commands.\nThere is no default direct gesture for each command, but you can attribute one normally in the input gesture dialog if you wish. The same way, You can also modify or delete the Magnifier layer access gesture (NVDA+Windows+O). Yet, you cannot modify the shortcut key of the Magnifier layer sub-commands.\nMagnifier's native commands\nThe result of the following Magnifier native commands may be reported by this add-on, according to its configuration:\n\u2022 Start Magnifier: Windows++ (on alpha-numeric keyboard or on numpad)\n\u2022 Quit Magnifier: Windows+Escape\n\u2022 Zoom in: Windows++ (on alpha-numeric keyboard or on numpad)\n\u2022 Zoom out: Windows+- (on alpha-numeric keyboard or on numpad)\n\u2022 Toggle color inversion: Control+Alt+I\n\u2022 Select the docked view: Control+Alt+D\n\u2022 Select the full screen view: Control+Alt+F\n\u2022 Select the lens view: Control+Alt+L\n\u2022 Cycle through the three view types: Control+Alt+M\n\u2022 Resize the lens with the keyboard: Shift+Alt+Left/Right/Up/DownArrow. Note: although this does not seem to be documented, this shortcut seems to have been withdrawn in recent Windows versions such as Windows 2004.\n\u2022 Move the magnified view: Control+Alt+Arrows (reporting only affects full screen mode)\nHere is also a list of other Magnifier native commands, just for information:\n\u2022 Control+Alt+mouseScrollWheel: Zooms in and out using the mouse scroll wheel.\n\u2022 Control+Windows+M: Opens the Magnifier's settings window.\n\u2022 Control+Alt+R: Resizes the lens with the mouse.\n\u2022 Control+Alt+Space: Quickly shows the entire desktop when using full screen view.\nNone of the Magnifier native commands can be modified.\nNotes\n\u2022 For computers equipped with an Intel graphic card, control+alt+arrow (left/right/up/down) are also shortcuts to modify the orientation of the screen. These shortcut are enabled by default and conflict with Windows Magnifiers shortcuts to move the view. You will need to disable them to be able to use them for the Magnifier. They can be disabled in the Intel control panel or in the Intel menu present in the system tray.\n\u2022 \nDepending on your Windows version, Alt+Shift+Arrow are Windows Magnifier shortcuts to resize the magnified view (lens or docked). When Magnifier is active (even in full screen mode), these shortcuts are captured by Magnifier and cannot be passed to the application, even if you press NVDA+F2 before. To use these shortcuts in the current application, you need to quit the Magnifier (Windows+Escape) and re-open it after (Windows++). For example in MS word, to decrease title level:\n\u2022 Press Windows+Escape to quit Magnifier.\n\u2022 Press Alt+Shift+RightArrow to decrease current title level.\n\u2022 Press Windows++ to re-open the Magnifier.\n\u2022 \nFor more information about Windows Magnifier's features and shortcuts, you may want to consult the following pages:\n\u2022 Use Magnifier to make things on the screen easier to see\n\u2022 Windows keyboard shortcuts for accessibility",

The default audio device will be saved in the NVDA settings and switching will not occur each time when NVDA starts.\n. 2If you don't want to change the NVDA configuration - just disable the function of switching audio devices in the Unmute settings panel.\nAdd-on settings dialog\nTo open the add-on settings panel, follow these steps:\n\u2022 Press NVDA+N to open NVDA menu.\n\u2022 Then go to \"Preferences\" -> \"Settings...\" and in the categories list find and open \"Unmute Windows Audio\".\nThat's it, you can now use the Tab key to move between add-on settings.\nThe following options are available in the add-on settings dialog:\n. 1\nThe first slider in the add-on settings dialog allows you to specify the volume level of Windows, which will be set when you start NVDA if the sound was previously muted or was too low.\n. 2\nThe minimum Windows volume level at which the volume up procedure will be applied. This slider allows you to adjust the sensitivity level of the add-on.\nIf the volume level drops to less than the value specified here, the volume will be increased the next time you start NVDA.\nOtherwise, if the volume level remains higher than the value specified here, then when you restart NVDA, its level will not change.\nAnd, of course, if the sound was previously turned off, when restarts add-on will turn it on anyway.\n. 3\nThe following check box allows to enable re-initialization of the voice synthesizer driver.\nThis procedure will only start if it is detected at NVDA startup that the voice synthesizer driver has not been initialized.\n. 4\nIn this field you can specify the number of attempts to re-initialize the voice synthesizer driver. Attempts are performed cyclically with an interval of 1 second. A value of 0 means that attempts will be performed indefinitely until the procedure is successfully completed.\n. 5\nThe \"Switch to the default output audio device\" option allows to check at startup the audio device on which NVDA sound is output. And, if this device differs from the default device, the output automatically switches to the audio device installed in the system as the main one.\n. 6\nThe next checkbox turns on or off playing the startup sound when the operation is successful.\nThird Party components\nThe add-on uses the following third-party components:\n\u2022 For interaction with the Windows Core Audio API - PyCaw module that is distributed under the MIT license.\n\u2022 For getting the information about running processes and using the PyCaw component - psutil module that is distributed under BSD-3 license.",

You will be able to update NVDA and their add-ons automatically from your corporate environment and even perform remote sessions, provided that your organization proxy server allows it.\nFeatures\n\u2022 Support for various proxy server types: http, socks4 and socks5.\n\u2022 Ability to redirect all traffic through the proxy server or only specific traffic (http, https, ftp).\n\u2022 Ability to redirect all traffic through a proxy server and, after that, redirect specific traffic through other servers (nested proxies).\n\u2022 Profile switch and config reset aware: if you usually work with a portable copy of NVDA, you can create various profiles for different environments (home, work, office1, office2) and manually activate them.\nUsage\nThis add-on adds a new category to the NVDA settings dialog called \"Proxy\". In this category, you will find four settings groups. The first one allows you to configure a general proxy for all traffic. The other groups allow you to configure proxy servers only for specific protocols. All groups have the following fields:\n\u2022 Host: hostname or ip address of the proxy server. Leave empty to disable that particular proxy.\n\u2022 Port: server port.\n\u2022 Username: optional. User name for server autentication.\n\u2022 Password: optional. Password for server autentication. Note that password is not required for socks4 servers.\nIn addition to the previous fields, the following options are available in the first settings group:\n\u2022 SOCKS proxy type: socks4, socks5 or http can be selected.\n\u2022 Use proxy for dns requests if possible: when this checkbox is checked, hostnames or domain names will be directly sent to and resolved on the proxy server. When it is unchecked, names will be resolved locally and the server will receive only the destination ip address. Note that not all socks4 proxy servers support this option.\nTipically, most users will only have to configure the first settings group. If you don't know your proxy details, ask your organization network administrator for more information.\nLimitations\n\u2022 Very limited IPV6 support.\n\u2022 UDP traffic is not supported on all proxy servers.\n\u2022 External DLL libraries won't respect the settings configured in this add-on.\n\u2022 Only basic autentication is supported for http proxy servers.

 "WordNav": [
  "2019.3 +",
  "WordNav NVDA add-on improves built-in navigation by word, as well as adds extra word navigation commands with different definition for the word.\nMost text editors support Control+LeftArrow/RightArrow commands for word navigation. However the definition of the word changes from one program to another. This is especially true of modern web-based text editors, such as Monaco. NVDA should know the definition of word in given program in order to speak words correctly. If NVDA doesn't know the exact definition, then either words are going to be skipped, or pronounced multiple times. Moreover, some web-based text editors position the cursor in the end of the word, instead of the beginning, making editing much harder for visually impaired users. In order to combat this problem I have created enhanced word navigation commands, that take the word definition from Notepad++ and they do not rely on program's definition of words, but rather parse lines into words on NVDA's side. The Control+LeftArrow/RightArrow gesture is not even sent to the program, thus ensuring the consistency of the speech.\nPlease note that a prototype of WordNav was formerly a part of Tony's enhancements add-on. Please either uninstall it or upgrade to Tony's enhancements latest stable version to avoid conflicts.\nCurrently WordNav supports four definitions of the word, assigned to different gestures:\n\u2022 Left Control+Arrows: Notepad++ definition, that treats alphanumeric characters as words, and adjacent punctuation marks are also treated as words. This should be the most convenient word definition for the majority of users.\n\u2022 RightControl+Arrows: Fine word definition splits camelCaseIdentifiers and underscore_separated_identifiers into separate parts, thus allowing the cursor to go into long identifiers.\n\u2022 LeftControl+Windows+Arrows: Bulky word definition treats almost all punctuation symbols adjacent to text as part of a single word, therefore it would treat paths like C:\\directory\\subdirectory\file.txt as a single word.\n\u2022 RightControl+Windows+Arros: Multiword definition, that groups several words together. The amount of words is configurable.\nGestures can be customized in WordNav settings panel.\nNotes\n\u2022 At this time WordNav doesn't modify Control+Shift+LeftArrow/RightArrow gestures to select words, since implementation of such commands are significantly more complicated.\n\u2022 If you would like to use virtual desktops feature of Windows 10, please remember to disable Control+Windows+Arrows keyboard shortcuts either in WordNav Settings panel, or in NVDA Input gestures dialog.\n\u2022 WordNav doesn't work reliably in VSCode, since due to its internal optimizations, VSCode presents only a few lines of file contents at a time, that change dynamically, and this occasionally interferes with WordNav algorithm.",

 "Console Toolkit": [
  "2019.3 and later",
  "Console Toolkit is NVDA add-on, that provides accessibility improvements for Windows console, also known as Command prompt. It also works well in Windows PowerShell. Some of the features may work in alternative terminals, such as Cygwin, PuTTY and Windows Terminal, however, the add-on has only been carefully tested with the default Windows Console. SSH users might find this add-on especially handy.\nSome of the features were previously part of Tony's enhancements add-on.\nDownloads\nConsole toolkit\nReal-time console speech\nThis option makes NVDA to speak new lines immediately as they appear in console output, instead of queueing new speech utterances. For example, if NVDA is busy speaking a line that appeared on the screen 1 minute ago, and now a new line appears, this option will cancel speaking the old line and start speaking the new line right away, thus providing a more real-time feedback on what's happening in console window.\nBeep on console updates\nBeep a low pitch impulse every time console text is updated.\nEnforce Control+V in consoles\nThis option makes Control+V shortcut to work inside ssh sessions.\nExperimental: command prompt editing\nNote: this feature is experimental. Please read this section carefully and make sure you understand how it works before reporting issues.\nPress NVDA+E to identify current prompt in console window and edit it in an accessible \"Edit prompt\" window. After editing you can either press Escape to update current command line, or Enter to update and immediately execute command. Alternatively you can press Alt+F4 to close edit prompt window without updating command line.\nThis feature has been tested in Windows command prompt cmd.exe as well as in bash shell over ssh connections, as well as in WSL and cygwin. It might also work in alternative Unix shells, however it hasn't been tested.\nHere is how add-on extracts current command.\n. 1It presses End key and then sends a control character, that is a rare Unicodecharacter not likely to be used anywhere.\n. 2Then it presses home key and sends another control character.\n. 3Then it waits for control characters to appear on the screen, which might take some time on slow SSH connections.\n. 4Command is what appears between two control characters.\n. 5When \"Use UI Automation to access the Windows Console when available\" option is enabled in NVDA settings, it sends one more control character in the beginning of the string. This is needed to parse multiline commands correctly: UIA implementation trims whitespaces in the end of each line, so in order to deduce whether there is a space between two lines, we need to shift them by one character. Please note, however, that this way we don't preserve the number of spaces between words, we only guarantee to preserve the presence of spaces.\n. 6Before editing add-on makes sure to remove control characters by placing cursor in the beginning and end and simulating Delete and Backspace key presses.\n. 7It presents command in \"Edit prompt\" window for user to view or edit.\n. 8\nAfter user presses Enter or Escape,it first erases current line in the console. This is achieved via one of four methods, the choice of the method is configurable. Currently four methods are supported:\n\u2022 Control+C: works in both cmd.exe and bash, but leaves previous prompt visible on the screen; doesn't work in emacs; sometimes unreliable on slow SSH connections\n\u2022 Escape: works only in cmd.exe\"),\n\u2022 Control+A Control+K: works in bash and emacs; doesn't work in cmd.exe\n\u2022 Backspace (recommended): works in all environments; however slower and may cause corruption if the length of the line has changed\n. 9\nThen add-on simulates keystrokes to type the updated command and optionally simulates Enter key press.\nTroubleshooting:\n\u2022 Verify that 'Home', 'End', 'Delete' and 'Backspace' keys work as expected in your console.\n\u2022 Verify that your console supports Unicode characters. Some ssh connections don't support Unicode.\n\u2022 Verify that selected deleting method works in your console.\nExperimental: capturing command output\nNote: this feature is experimental. Please read this section carefully and make sure you understand how it works before reporting issues.\nWhile in command line or in \"Edit prompt\" window, press Control+Enter to capture command output. This add-on is capable of capturing large output that spans multiple screens, although when output is larger than 10 screens capturing process takes significant time to complete. Add-on will play a long chime sound, and it will last as long as the add-on is capturing the output of currently running command, or until timeout has been reached. Alternatively, press NVDA+E to interrupt capturing.\nWhen \"Use UI Automation to access the Windows Console when available\" feature is enabled in NVDA settings, you can switch to other windows while capturing is going on. However, if this option is disabled, then NVDA is using a legacy console code, that only works when consoel is focused, and therefore switching to any other window will pause capturing.\nCommand capturing works by redirecting command output to less command. Default suffix that is appended to commands is: |less -c 2>&1 Please only change it if you know what you're doing. This add-on knows how to interact with the output of less command to retrieve output page by page.\nOn Windows less.exe tool needs to be installed separately. You can install it via cygwin, or download a windows binary elsewhere.\nIf you are using tmux or screen in Linux, please make sure that no status line is displayed in the bottom. In tmux run tmux set status off to get rid of status line, or modify your tmux.conf file.\nTroubleshooting:\n\u2022 After a failed output capturing attempt, press UpArrow in the console to check what command has actually been executed.\n\u2022 Revert back to default capturing suffix, mentioned above.\n\u2022 Try troubleshooting steps from \"command prompt editing\" section.",

 "Numpad Nav Mode": [
  "unnown",
  "Numpad Nav Mode is an NVDA add-on, which allows you to easily switch your keyboard's numpad between NVDA's navigation controls and the non-screenreader Windows navigation controls.\nThe normal functions of the PC number pad, with numlock off, are: page up, page down, home, end, four-way arrow keys, and a delete key. But NVDA completely takes over the numpad, to provide review keys, mouse controls, and object navigation controls. This is true even in laptop keyboard mode, which duplicates those functions on non-numpad keys for those who do not have a numpad.\nHowever some users do have a numpad on their laptop, and would prefer to use it for Windows navigation purposes, especially because some laptops do not provide home, end, or other such keys. That is where this add-on can help. Additionally, some desktop users may sometimes find it convenient to use the numpad for those keyboard functions rather than the normal keys, which this add-on enables.\nHow it works\nWith numlock off, no matter what keyboard layout you are using, this add-on will let you press Alt+NVDA+NumpadPlus (which is usually the long key second up on the right), to quickly and easily switch between the normal NVDA navigation controls, and the classic Windows navigation controls. This key can be remapped under Input Gestures, in the Input section.\nNote that this add-on doesn't disable the use of numpad insert as an NVDA modifier, if you have it set as such. If you want that feature, please let me know, although you can manually turn off numpad insert as a modifier in NVDA keyboard settings.\nIf you would prefer to have NVDA start with the Windows nav mode active by default, you can configure that in NVDA configuration. Go to NVDA's preferences, then settings, and find the Numpad Nav Mode settings panel. There you will be able to select a checkbox to turn Windows Nav Mode on by default when you start NVDA. To get there quickly, press NVDA+N, P, S, then N one or more times until you hear \"Numpad Nav Mode\".",

  "2019.2.1 +",
  "An add-on for NVDA to announce the time in selected timezones.\nIntroduction\nFor a very long time now, Windows has had the ability to show multiple clocks from different timezones. Users can customize the clocks and they become instantly visible.\nUnfortunately, for users of screen readers such as NVDA or JAWS, there is no simple way to get this information. These screen readers don't support additional clocks, so blind computer users have to resort to other, third-party solutions, some of which are paid.\nA lot of the work I do involves working across timezones, and eventually I got tired of manually converting times in my head, especially for timezones that aren't aligned to the hour (such as India which is +5:30 UTC).\nFor these reasons, I've created this add-on for NVDA. The add-on lets you hear times in selected timezones through the use of the timezone ring.\nUsage\nThe add-on supports both the legacy and the Python 3 version of NVDA.\nOnce the add-on is installed, press NVDA+N to bring up NVDA's context menu. Arrow down to \"Preferences\" and then up to \"Time Zoner\".\nPress ENTER on \"Configure timezone ring\".\nYou will be presented with a dialog to set the timezones for which you want the time and date announced.\nSelect items in the timezone list to add them to your timezone ring. Deselect (or press the Remove button) to delete them from the ring.\nYou can also reorder the timezones in the ring by using the Move Up and Move Down buttons.\nUse the \"Filter\" box to search for specific timezones.\nCheck the \"Announce abbreviated timezones\" box to hear abbreviated timezone names such as IST or GMT. Uncheck the box to hear the full timezone names such as Asia/Kolkata or Europe/London.\nWhen you are finished configuring the timezones, press the Save button.\nFrom here on, you can press NVDA+Alt+T to announce times and dates in your timezone ring.\nWhen you first install the add-on, NVDA will default to your local timezone if it can get it.\nChange Log\nVersion 1.03, released on 03/21/2020\n\u2022 The add-on no longer crashes if the default timezone can't be set.\n\u2022 Fixed an issue with relative links in the documentation.\nVersion 1.02, released on 03/18/2020\n\u2022 When installing a new version of this add-on, the settings from a previous installation are no longer lost.\n\u2022 Other changes to conform to NVDA add-on standard compliance.\nVersion 1.01, released on 03/12/2020\n\u2022 The time and date are announced in the user's locale, meaning that 24-hour time is honored if set.\n\u2022 NVDA will announce either the abbreviated or full timezone depending on the user's setting in the Timezone Ring dialog. For example, it will either say Europe/London, or it will say GMT or BST. This setting is controlled by checking or unchecking the \"Announce abbreviated timezones\" checkbox.\n\u2022 Add-on includes translator comments (@ruifontes).\n\u2022 Add-on now includes header comments (@ruifontes).\n\u2022 The Escape key closes the Timezone Ring dialog (@ruifontes).\n\u2022 The menu item to open the Timezone Ring dialog is now named appropriately (@ruifontes).\n\u2022 NVDA now defaults to the local timezone on installation of this add-on, if the local timezone is available.\n\u2022 Support for multiple timezones through the use of a timezone ring.\n\u2022 This add-on now uses the key NVDA+Alt+T to prevent conflict with the Clock add-on.\n\u2022 The timezone selector dialog now has a filter box. NVDA will announce the number of results as the user starts typing into the filter field.\n\u2022 Python 2 support\n\u2022 The date and time is now announced in a separate thread to prevent hanging the NVDA thread in case retrieval takes a little while.\n\u2022 The timezone selector dialog now has a Cancel button and no longer prevents NVDA from shutting down.",

 "Tony's enhancements": [
  "2019.3",
  "This add-on contains a number of small improvements to NVDA screen reader, each of them too small to deserve a separate add-on.\nThis add-on is only compatible with NVDA versions 2019.3 and above.\nEnhanced table navigation commands\n\u2022 Control+Alt+Home/End - jump to the first/last column in the table.\n\u2022 Control+Alt+PageUp/PageDown - jump to the first/last row in the table.\n\u2022 NVDA+Control+digit - jump to 1st/2nd/3rd/... 10th column in the table.\n\u2022 NVDA+Alt+digit - jump to 1st/2nd/3rd/... 10th row in the table.\n\u2022 NVDA+Shift+DownArrow - read current column in the table starting from current cell down.\nDynamic keystrokes\nYou can assign certain keystrokes to be dynamic. After issuing such a keystroke, NVDA will be checking currently focused window for any updates and if the line is updated, NVDA will speak it automatically. For example, certain keystrokes in text editors should be marked dynamic, such as Jump to bookmark, jump to another line and debugging keystrokes,such as step into/step over.\nThe format of dynamic keystrokes table is simple: every line contains a rule in the following format:\n\nappName keystroke\nwhere appName is the name of the application where this keystroke is marked dynamic (or * to b marked dynamic in all applications), andkeystroke is a keystroke in NVDA format, for example, control+alt+shift+pagedown.\nReal-time console output\nThis option is disabled by default and must be enabled in the settings.\nThis option makes NVDA to speak new lines immediately as they appear in console output, instead of queueing new speech utterances.\nThere is also an option to beep on command line updates - this would give you a better idea when new lines are printed in the console.\nBeep when NVDA is busy\nCheck this option for NVDA to provide audio feedback when NVDA is busy. NVDA being busy does not necessarily indicate a problem with NVDA, but rather this is a signal to the user that any NVDA commands will not be processed immediately.\nNVDA volume\n\u2022 NVDA+Control+PageUp/PageDown - adjust NVDA volume.\nThis option controls the volume of NVDA speech as well as all the other sounds and beeps produced by NVDA. The advantage of this option compared to adjusting volume of a speech synthesizer, is that it affects the volume of all the beeps proportionally.\nBlocking double insert keystroke\nIn NVDA pressing Insert key twice in a row toggles insert mode in applications. However, sometimes it happens accidentally and it triggers insert mode. Since this is a special keystroke, it cannot be disabled in the settings. This add-on provides a way to block this keyboard shortcut. When double insert is blocked, insert mode can stil be toggled by pressing NVDA+F2 and then Insert.\nThis option is disabled by default and must be enabled in the settings.",

 "Audio Themes": [

  "This add-on creates a virtual audio display that plays sounds when focusing or navigating objects (such as buttons, links etc...) the audio will be played in a location that corresponds to the object's location in the visual display.\nThe add-on also enables you to activate, install, remove, edit, create, and distribute audio theme packages.\nUsage\nThis add-on enables you to perform three distinct tasks, including managing your installed audio themes, editing the currently active audio theme, and creating a new audio theme.\nYou can access these functions from the add-on's menu which is found in the main NVDA menu.\nManaging Your Audio Themes\n\u2022 The 'Manage Audio Themes' dialogue enables you to activate or deactivate audio themes, in addition to installing and removing audio themes.\n\u2022 In this dialogue there are some additional options including:\n\u2022 Play sounds in 3D mode: When you uncheck this box the add-on will play the sounds in mono mode (always in the centre of the audio display) regardless of the object location.\n\u2022 Speak role such as button, edit box , link etc.: When you uncheck this box NVDA will start announcing the role when focusing objects rather than ignoring it (which is the default behaviour when installing this add-on).\n\u2022 Use Synthesizer Volume: Checking this box will set the sound player of this add-on to use the active voice sound, thus making all audible output the same as the voice volume when ever you change that volume.\n\u2022 Audio Theme Volume Slider: Alternatively you can set the volume for the add-on using this slider. Setting it to 0 will mute all sounds, and 100 is the maximum volume.\nEditing The Active Audio Theme:\n\u2022 When you click on the 'Edit the active audio theme' option, a dialogue will open with a list containing all the sounds contained in the currently active theme. From this dialogue you can:\n\u2022 Change Selected: Selecting a sound from the list and clicking this button, will open a standard open file dialogue, select an ogg or wave audio file from your file system to replace the selected sound, and click OK to complete the process.\n\u2022 Remove Selected: This will remove the selected sound from the theme, click 'Yes' to confirm the removal process, and the selected sound will be removed.\n\u2022 Add New Sound: When clicking this button a new dialogue will be shown. From the first combo box in the newly opened dialogue select the object type you want to assign the sound to it, for example (button, link, tab, menu and so on), then click the 'Browse to an audio file' button to select the sound you want to assign for the previously selected object type. Optionally you can click the preview button to preview the sound, and finally clicking the OK button will apply the changes and assign the selected sound to the selected object.\n\u2022 Close: Will exit the dialogue without performing any action.\nCreating A New Audio Theme\n\u2022 If you have a good sound production skills you can apply them here and create an audio theme of your own, rather than editing an existing one. To do this you can follow these steps. - Collect your audio files in one place, they must be in ogg or wave format, and rename them to what ever make sense to you. For example when I was creating the default audio theme for this add-on, I grouped sounds according to interaction patterns, for example, the combo box, the drop down button, and the split button can all have the same sound, while the Check box, The toggle button, and the menu check item can have the same sound. - From the add-on menu click 'Create a new audio theme' - A dialogue will be opened asking you for some information about your new audio theme, including: * Theme Name : The name of your theme which will be shown in the audio themes manager. This must be a valid windows folder name. * Your Name: Enter your real name or a nick name.\n\u2022 Theme description : A Brief description about your audio theme. - Click OK to move to the next step. - In the next step a dialogue similar to the 'Audio Themes Editor' will be shown, and from their the process is the same as the Theme editing process, so refer to 'Editing The Active Audio Theme' section.\nCopyright:\nCopyright (c) 2014-2016 Musharraf Omer and Others\nAlthough this add-on was started as an independent project, it evolved to be an enhanced version of the 'Unspoken' add-on by Austin Hicks and Bryan Smart. The majority of this add-on's development went into creating the tools to manage, edit and create audio theme packages. So a big thank you to them for creating such a wonderful add-on, and making it available for us to build on top of their work.\nA Note on Third-party audio files:\nThe Default audio theme package in this add-on uses sounds from several sources, here is a breakdown for them: - Unspoken 3D Audio: An add-on for NVDA - TWBlue: A free and open source twitter client - Mushy TalkBack: An alternative talkback with better sounds.",

 "Debug Helper": [

  "The purpose of this add-on is to make debugging things in NVDA easier. New features will be added based on user suggestions. All emails or GitHub issues with feedback or feature ideas are most welcome.\nKey Command\n\u2022 NVDA+Shift+F1: Inserts a mark line in the NVDA log.\nExplanation and Usage\nWhen you press the command key, the add-on inserts a line like the following in the NVDA log (at the Info level):\n-- Mark 1 --\nIt will also announce: \"Logged Mark 1!\"\nIf you press the key again, you will get:\n-- Mark 2 --\nand \"Logged Mark 2!\" will be spoken.\nLet us say for example that you were about to perform a series of tasks, that you know generate lengthy error content in the NVDA log. You are going to post the relevant portions of your log to a mailing list or the NVDA GitHub issue tracker. However you don't want to hunt through your entire log to find the relevant content. So you use this add-on to insert mark 1, right before you do the thing that causes the first error. If you know something else will generate further errors, or a different kind, you insert another mark to separate that error from the previous one, or so you can say \"this is what I was doing at mark 3, where some errors occurred.\" Another example: While using some application, something happens that causes an error (maybe you hear the Windows error sound). You want to go back and find that error later, but you don't want to stop working and save the log right now. So you use this add-on again, to insert a mark in your log. This time the mark will appear after the errors in your log, instead of before. But either way, the marks will help you narrow down the important sections of your log.\nThe mark lines shown above can be easily searched for with the find command in a text editor such as Notepad or Notepad++. Additionally, by default, there is a blank line inserted above each mark. Blank lines are also possible after the mark. Blank lines can be helpful if you are using NVDA's log viewer, or another text editor, and want to use the arrow keys to quickly read up/down through the log, to find a particular mark. It is easy to pick the word \"blank\" out of a bunch of text being spoken as you quickly move through the log. If you arrow really fast, you might need more than one blank line, which you can adjust in settings.\nNote: The mark count will survive the reloading of plugins (NVDA+Control+F3), but will start back at one if you restart NVDA.\nConfiguration:\nIn the Settings section of NVDA Preferences, you will find a \"Debug Helper\" category. In the settings dialog you can change the number of blank lines inserted before and after each mark line. The default is one line before, and zero after, although you can use 0 through 10 lines for either. Under the Tools category of NVDA's Input Gestures panel, you can change NVDA+Shift+F1 to a key sequence of your choice.\nChangelog\n\u2022 \nVersion 1.0.2 (2019-08-28)\n\u2022 Translation and code cleanup.\n\u2022 \nVersion 1.0.1 (2019-08-26)\n\u2022 Minor bugfix version to probably fix an install problem on certain versions of Windows.\n\u2022 \nVersion 1.0 (2019-08-22)\n\u2022 \nInitial release.

  "This addon aims at adding online image recognition engines to NVDA.\nThere are two types of engines. OCR and image describer.\nOCR extract text from image.\nImage describer describe visual features in image in text form, such as general description, color type landmarks and so on.\nInternet connection is required to use this addon, since image describe services are provided by API endpoints on the Internet.\nThey are called engines in this addon.\nThere are three types of engine for this addon.\n\u2022 Online OCR engine\n\u2022 Online image describer engine\n\u2022 Windows 10 OCR engine (offline)\nYou also need to choose the source of recognition image.\n\u2022 Current navigator object\n\u2022 Current foreground window\n\u2022 The whole screen\n\u2022 Image data or file from clipboard\n\u2022 Image file pathname or image url from clipboard\nKeyboard commands\nAfter choosing these types, you can start recognition with one gesture.\nNVDA+Alt+P Perform recognize according to source and engine type setting, Then read result. If pressed twice, open a virtual result document.\nThere are four additional gestures left unassigned. Please assign them before using.\nCycle through different recognition engine types.\nCycle through different recognition source types.\nCancel current recognition\nThis gesture can be useful if you think you have waited for too long and want to cancel.\nAlso sometimes you do not want to be disturbed by recognition message because you need to review some messages arrived after recognition start.\nShow previous result in a virtual result document.\nThough there is a feature to copy result to clipboard. Character position information cannot be preserved, so this gesture is added to solve this problem.\nThere are also four old gestures are left unassigned for users who prefer gestures in previous versions.\nIt is recommended to use new gesture and switch engine type according to your need.\nRecognize current navigator object with online OCR engine Then read result. If pressed twice, open a virtual result document.\nRecognizes image in clipboard with online OCR engine. Then read result. If pressed twice, open a virtual result document.\nRecognize current navigator object Then read result. If pressed twice, open a virtual result document.\nRecognizes image in clipboard . Then read result. If pressed twice, open a virtual result document.\nEngine Configuration\nYou can choose recognition engines and configure them in detail in Online Image Describer category in NVDA settings dialog.\nThe author of addon have registered account with free API quota and set up a proxy server on www.nvdacn.com to make this addon easier to test at first. Test quota is limited and may be cancelled by API provider anytime.\nIt is highly recommended to register your own key according to guide in each engine.\nThe following settings are applicable to all engines.\n\u2022 Copy recognition result to the clipboard: if enabled, recognition result text will be copied to clipboard after recognition.\n\u2022 Use browseable message for text result: if enabled, recognition result text will be shown in a popup window instead of speech or braille message.\n\u2022 Swap the effect of repeated gesture with none repeated ones: by default, a virtual result document is shown only if you press the corresponding gesture twice, if you use that frequently you can enable this option so that you only need to press once to get a result viewer.\n\u2022 Enable more verbose logging for debug purposes: some logs are essential for debugging but affects performance and takes up a lot of space. Only turn this on if specifically instructed to by the addon author or an NVDA developer.\n\u2022 Proxy type: which type of proxy you are using. If you do not know what a proxy is just leave it as is.\n\u2022 Proxy address: full URL of your proxy. If you do not know what a proxy is just leave it as is. If you choose to use proxy your proxy will be verified before saving , after verification, there will be a prompt to tell you result.\nThe following settings means the same in all engines, describe them here to save space.\n\u2022 \nAPI Access Type: this controls how you get access to the corresponding API endpoints.\n\u2022 If you choose \"Use public quota\", you are using free quota in an account registered by addon author.\n\u2022 If you choose \"Use your own API key\", this addon will use quota from your own account.\n\u2022 \nAPP ID, API key or API Secret Key: if you want to use quota from your own account corresponding access tokens is required. Some engines only need API key. Some engines require two tokens. These are only valid if you choose \"use your own API key\" in API Access type.\nNote that the quality and accuracy of results are affected by many factors.\n\u2022 Models and techniques used by engine provider\n\u2022 Quality of uploaded image\n\u2022 Is navigator object hidden behind something else\n\u2022 Screen resolution\nOnline image description\nHere are three engines available.\nMicrosoft Azure Image Analyser\nThis engine extracts a rich set of visual features based on the image content.\nThis engine is english only. If you want description in other languages, you can use Microsoft Azure Image Describer\nVisual Features include:\n\u2022 Adult - detects if the image is pornographic in nature (depicts nudity or a sex act). Sexually suggestive content is also detected.\n\u2022 Brands - detects various brands within an image, including the approximate location. The Brands argument is only available in English.\n\u2022 Categories - categorizes image content according to a taxonomy defined in documentation.\n\u2022 Color - determines the accent color, dominant color, and whether an image is black&white.\n\u2022 Description - describes the image content with a complete sentence in supported languages.\n\u2022 Faces - detects if faces are present. If present, generate coordinates, gender and age.\n\u2022 ImageType - detects if image is clip art or a line drawing.\n\u2022 Objects - detects various objects within an image, including the approximate location. The Objects argument is only available in English.\n\u2022 Tags - tags the image with a detailed list of words related to the image content.\nSome features also provide additional details:\n\u2022 Celebrities - identifies celebrities if detected in the image.\n\u2022 Landmarks - identifies landmarks if detected in the image.\nMicrosoft Azure Image describer\nThis engine generates a description of an image in human readable language with complete sentences. The description is based on a collection of content tags, which are also returned by the operation.\nMore than one description can be generated for each image. Descriptions are ordered by their confidence score.\nThere are two settings for this engine.\n\u2022 Language: the language in which the service will return a description of the image. English by default.\n\u2022 Maximum Candidates: maximum number of candidate descriptions to be returned. The default is 1.\nOnline OCR\nOnline engines rely on the use and presence of the following services.\nhttps://www.nvdacn.com\nhttps://ocr.space/ocrapi\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/\nhttp://ai.qq.com\nhttp://ai.baidu.com\nhttp://ai.sogou.com/\nhttps://intl.cloud.tencent.com\nEngines\nThere are five engines available.\nTencent Cloud OCR\nThis API is sponsored by Tencent Cloud and Aceessibility Research Association, with a quota of 15000 per day.\nThis engine support 19 languages.\n\u2022 Chinese-English mix\n\u2022 Japanese\n\u2022 Korean\n\u2022 Spanish\n\u2022 French\n\u2022 German\n\u2022 Portuguese\n\u2022 Vietnamese\n\u2022 Malay\n\u2022 Russian\n\u2022 Italian\n\u2022 Dutch\n\u2022 Swedish\n\u2022 Finnish\n\u2022 Danish\n\u2022 Norwegian\n\u2022 Hungarian\n\u2022 Thai\n\u2022 Latin\nHere is the settings of this engine.\n\u2022 Language: Text language for recognition.

English by default.\n\u2022 Detect image orientation: if set to true, the API autorotates the image correctly.\n\u2022 Scale image for better quality: if set to true, the API does some internal upscaling. This can improve the OCR result significantly, especially for low-resolution PDF scans.\n\u2022 Optimize for table recognition: if set to true, the OCR logic makes sure that the parsed text result is always returned line by line. This switch is recommended for table OCR, receipt OCR, invoice processing and all other type of input documents that have a table like structure.\nIf you want to use your own key, you also need to specify API Key.\nYou can get your own free API key by registering onOCR space\nHere is a simple guide.\nFind the link \"Register for free API key\"\nClick on it and you will find a form to fill in.\nThe form asks you to enter the following data\n\u2022 Email Address\n\u2022 First Name\n\u2022 Last Name\n\u2022 How do you plan to use the OCR API?\nAfter filling it and submit. You may also need to pass a captcha\nThen you will receive a confirmation e-mail\nFind the link named \"Yes, subscribe me to this list.\" in that e-mail. Access that link and you will receive API key by e-mail soon.\nMicrosoft Azure OCR\nThis engine uses OCR API in Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Computer Vision.\nIt supports 24 languages including\n\u2022 Chinese Simplified\n\u2022 Chinese Traditional\n\u2022 Czech\n\u2022 Danish\n\u2022 Dutch\n\u2022 English\n\u2022 Finnish\n\u2022 French\n\u2022 German\n\u2022 Greek\n\u2022 Hungarian\n\u2022 Italian\n\u2022 Japanese\n\u2022 Korean\n\u2022 Norwegian\n\u2022 Polish\n\u2022 Portuguese\n\u2022 Russian\n\u2022 Spanish\n\u2022 Swedish\n\u2022 Turkish\n\u2022 Arabic\n\u2022 Romanian\n\u2022 Serbian Cyrillic\n\u2022 Serbian Latin\n\u2022 Slovak\nHere are settings for this engine:\n\u2022 Language: text language for recognition. Auto detection by default.\n\u2022 Detect image orientation: if set to true, the API autorotates the image correctly.\nIf you use your own key, you should get a subscription key for using Microsoft Computer Vision API from the link below:\nStep 1: Create an account on Azure website\nPlease note that the key must be created for the Computer Vision API. The first \"GET API key\" button you encounter with single key navigation. Currently Microsoft provides the option to create a trial key for 7 days. You can also sign up for a free azure account for more trail. Signing up requires a credit card. If you already have a subscription account, you can skip this step.\nStep 2: Deploy Cognitive Services\nNow you have an azure account.\nFirst login on Azure Portal\nWait until you get the message Portal is Ready you are logged into azure portal.\nFind the link called All resources after All services button and activate it.\nWait until you get the message Blade All resources are ready , your focus will be an edit box, then press shift tab find a menu item called add and activate it.\nWait until you get the message Search the Marketplace, type Cognitive Services and press down arrow.\nWait until you get the message List of options Cognitive Services one of five, then press enter.\nWait until you get the message Blade Cognitive Services is ready press tab or b to find a button named Create activate it.\nWait until you get the message Blade Create is ready, your focus will be an edit box, type a name for this resource.

Usually you can leave it as is.\nPress tab to go to Location combo box. Choose one close to your current location.\nBe sure to remember this since location is required in engine configuration.\nPress tab to go to Pricing tie combo box. Usually a free tie like F0 is adequate. If that is not enough you can choose other tier after reading full pricing details in View full pricing details link.\nPress tab to go to Create new Resource group edit box.

Press tab find Create new button.\nThen press tab go to Create Button to create this resource.\nWait until you get the message Deployment succeeded.\nThen find Go to resource button sometimes you need go up to activate Notifications button before you can find Go to resource button.\nWait until you get the message Blade Quick Start is busy.\nFind the link named keys, then activate it.\nWait until you get the message Blade Manage keys is ready.\nFind edit box named key 1 or key 2. The content of that edit box is the API key required in engine configuration. Press Ctrl-C to copy it for engine configuration\nThen you can fill in these two settings required if you use your own API key.\n\u2022 Azure resource Region: the region you choose when deploying Cognitive Services in Azure Portal.\n\u2022 API key: the key you get after successfully deploying Cognitive Services in Azure Portal, KEY 2 is recommended.\nBaidu OCR\nThis one is also a paid API with free quota provided by Baidu.\nBaidu OCR supports 10 languages including\n\u2022 Chinese and English mixture\n\u2022 English\n\u2022 Portuguese\n\u2022 French\n\u2022 German\n\u2022 Italian\n\u2022 Spanish\n\u2022 Russian\n\u2022 Japanese\n\u2022 Korean\nThis engine can also get position of every character\nHere are its settings:\n\u2022 \nGet position of every character allows you to do more precise operation on some inaccessible application. Enabling this will make recognition slightly slower.\n\u2022 \nUse Accurate API: if is enabled will use a different endpoint. That accurate endpoint takes longer time but has higher quality and (If you use your own API key its price is also higher).\nIt has four endpoints with separate quota limit.\n\u2022 Basic OCR without any information about text location. Currently 50000 times a day.\n\u2022 Basic OCR with information about text location. Currently 500 times a day.\n\u2022 Accurate OCR without any information about text location. Currently 500 times a day.\n\u2022 Accurate with information about text location. Currently 50 times a day.\nIf you press the gesture which only read result, you are using endpoints without any information about text location.\nIf you press the gesture which shows an result viewer, you are using endpoints with information about text location.\nThough it provides a quite generous free quota, its website is Chinese only and not quite accessible.\nTencent AI OCR\nThis API is free to use with frequency limit about two query per second.\nIf you want to bypass the limit you can register your own API key. The website of this API is Chinese only and not quite accessible.\nThere is no information about language support in the document. According to my test Chinese and English and their mixture is supported.\nThere is no additional configuration for this API.",

  "Do you have kids or pets at home? Do you have a cat and It likes very much climbing your table and walking over your keyboard? Do you accidentally move the mouse to random parts in the screen while using your laptop? Then Input Lock is for you! You will be able to leave your computer alone and turned on without risk.\nOnce installed, you will be able to lock your keyboard, touch screen, if your laptop has one, mouse and Braille display.\nUsage\nThis addon adds two extra gestures to NVDA. By default they are unassigned, so you will have to configure them from Input gestures dialog. Read the NVDA User Guide for more information.\nWhen you press the toggle input lock gesture, NVDA will say \"Input locked\". Your input devices will be blocked until you press the same gesture again. In that moment, NVDA will say \"Input unlocked\" and everything will work as usual.\nIf you press the toggle mouse block gesture, your mouse will be locked. Press this command again to unlock it. While mouse is locked, you can use NVDA gestures to move it, and click with left and right buttons, but You can't move the mouse itself. Mouse clicks can also be disabled from Input lock category in NVDA settings dialog (NVDA 2018.2 and later) or from add-on settings dialog for older versions, available under preferences menu. In addition, from these settings you can control wether mouse locks when NVDA is started or not.\nNote: when mouse clicks are blocked, you can't use any NVDA gestures to work with the mouse.\nLimitations and known problems\nInput Lock has the following known problems:\n\u2022 The shortcuts control+alt+del and windows+l can be used even when the keyboard is locked.\n\u2022 NVDA unlocks the keyboard and other input methods when the computer wakes up from standby mode or the session is restored from the Windows lock screen.\n\u2022 On some laptops, the touchpad still accepts user input after mouse is blocked.",

  "This add-on brings NVDA Core issue 3208 to life: ability to check for, download, and apply add-on updates.\nTo check for updates after installing this add-on, go to NVDA menu/Tools/Check for add-on updates. If updates are available, a list of add-on updates will be shown, with each entry consisting of description, current version, and the new version. Select Update, and NVDA will download and apply updates in sequence, with a prompt to restart your NVDA shown afterwards.\nThe following add-ons provide built-in update feature and thus updates will not be checked via this add-on:\n\u2022 Braille Extender\n\u2022 WeatherPlus\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n\u2022 This is a proof of concept add-on. Once the relevant feature is included in NVDA, this add-on will be discontinued.\n\u2022 If the new add-on updates specify a compatibility range (minimum and last tested NVDA versions) and if the NVDA version you are running does not fall within the compatibility range according to NVDA, add-on updating will not proceed.\n\u2022 Not all add-ons come with development releases. If you are not getting updates after choosing to install development versions of an add-on, switch to stable channel for affected add-ons.\n\u2022 On some systems (particularly computers joined to a corporate domain), add-on update check functionality may not work properly, therefore add-on updates must be downloaded manually.\nVersion 22.02\n\u2022 NVDA 2021.3 or later is required.\n\u2022 On Windows 10, add-on update toast notifications are localized.\nVersion 22.01\n\u2022 NVDA 2021.2 or later is required.\n\u2022 On server systems running Windows Server 2016 and later, add-on updates will be presented in a dialog instead of using toast notifications.\nVersion 21.10\n\u2022 It is again possible to check for add-on updates on some systems, notably after a clean Windows installation.\nVersion 21.09\n\u2022 NVDA 2021.1 or later is required.\n\u2022 on Windows 10 and later, it is possible to select add-on update notification between a toast message and an update dialog. This can be configured from Add-on Updater settings found in NVDA Settings screen.\n\u2022 Add-on Updater will no longer check minimum Windows release information for add-ons as add-ons such as Windows App Essentials provide better Windows compatibility information.\nVersion 21.07\n\u2022 On Windows 10 and later, a toast notification will be shown when add-on updates are available. Note that you cannot click this notification - you must open NvDA menu/Tools/Check for add-on updates to review updates.\n\u2022 When legacy add-ons dialog is shown at startup, you can now review legacy add-ons and reasons just like add-on updates.\n\u2022 Improved add-on update check internals, including use of add-on metadata collection provided by the community to validate add-on compatibility. Among other things, this eliminates add-on releases for adding update checks for new add-ons.\nVersion 21.05\n\u2022 NvDA will no longer play error tones if trying to check updates while using NVDA 2021.1 alpha snapshots, caused by changes to wxPython GUI toolkit.\nVersion 21.03\n\u2022 NVDA 2020.4 or later is required.\n\u2022 NVDA will present an error dialog if errors occur while checking for add-on updates such as loss of Internet connection.\nVersion 20.11\n\u2022 NVDA 2020.3 or later is required.\n\u2022 Resolved more coding style issues and potential bugs with Flake8.\n\u2022 NVDA will no longer play error tones or appear to do nothing when using the add-on while NVDA is running from source code.

NVDA itself will check add-on compatibility.\nVersion 19.11\n\u2022 When add-on updates are available, NVDA will announce how many updates are available.\nVersion 19.09\n\u2022 Requires NVDA 2019.2 or later.\n\u2022 Timeout errors seen when attempting to download some add-on updates (notably add-on files hosted on GitHub) has been resolved.\nVersion 19.04\n\u2022 Requires NVDA 2019.1 or later.\n\u2022 When installing add-on updates, both minimum and last tested versions will be checked.\nVersion 19.01\n\u2022 Requires NVDA 2018.4 or later.\n\u2022 Improved responsiveness when checking for add-on updates.\n\u2022 Made the add-on more compatible with Python 3.\nVersion 18.12.2\n\u2022 Python 3 ready.\n\u2022 Fixed compatibility with recent NVDA alpha snapshots where add-on updates would not download.\nVersion 18.12.1\n\u2022 Added localizations.\nVersion 18.12\n\u2022 Updates for disabled add-ons can be checked. They will stay disabled after updating them.\n\u2022 During updates, if an add-on requires specific NVDA version and/or Windows release, these will be checked, and if one of these does not match, an error message will be shown and update will be aborted, resulting in no changes to already installed add-on version.\n\u2022 When automatic update check is enabled and when updates are ready, NVDA will present the updates list instead of asking if you wish to review updates.\nVersion 18.10\n\u2022 Initial stable release (still marked as proof of concept).",

Choose any math rule and select the \"Edit\" to enter the editing entry.\nThe \"editing entry\" can be divided into two major blocks, the \"Serialized ordering\" and the \"Child role\".\n\u2022 Serialized ordering: Math rule is divided into multiple blocks according to the reading order. In this area, the reading order of child node and the delimitation text of start, inter- and the end can be changed. Taking the fractional rule mfrac as an example, this rule is divided into five reading blocks. The order 0, 2, and 4 represent the initial prompt, the project segmentation prompt, and the end prompt, respectively, and the meanings text can be changed in each field. Order 1 and 3 adjust the reading sequence of child node which can be changed in the drop-down menu.\n\u2022 Child role: The next-level sub-item of the mathematical rule. Taking the fractional rule mfrac as an example, the rule contains the numerator and the denominator.

To do so, go to the \u2014 Representation of undefined characters \u2014 settings. You can choose between the following representations:\n\u2022 Use braille table behavior (no description possible)\n\u2022 Dots 1-8 (\u28ff)\n\u2022 Dots 1-6 (\u283f)\n\u2022 Empty cell (\u2800)\n\u2022 Other dot pattern (e.g.: 6-123456)\n\u2022 Question mark (depending on output table)\n\u2022 Other sign/pattern (e.g.: ??)\n\u2022 Hexadecimal\n\u2022 Hexadecimal, HUC8\n\u2022 Hexadecimal, HUC6\n\u2022 Decimal\n\u2022 Octal\n\u2022 Binary\nYou can also combine this option with the \u201cdescribe the character if possible\u201d setting.\nNotes:\n\u2022 To distinguish the undefined set of characters while maximizing space, the best combination is the usage of the HUC8 representation without checking the \u201cShow punctuation/symbol name for undefined characters if available\u201d option.\n\u2022 To learn more about the HUC representation, see https://danielmayr.at/huc/\n\u2022 Keep in mind that definitions in tables and those in your table dictionaries take precedence over character descriptions, which also take precedence over the chosen representation for undefined characters.\nGetting Current Character Info\nThis feature allows you to obtain various information regarding the character under the cursor using the current input braille table, such as: the HUC8 and HUC6 representations; the hexadecimal, decimal, octal or binary values; A description of the character if possible; the Unicode braille representation and the braille pattern dots.\nPressing the defined gesture associated to this function once shows you the information in a flash message and a double-press displays the same information in a virtual NVDA buffer.\nOn supported displays the defined gesture is \u2849+space. No system gestures are defined by default.\nFor example, for the '&' character, we will get the following information:\n&: 0x26, 38, 0o46, 0b100110\nand (AMPERSAND [Po])\n\u28bf (1234568)\n\u28e5\u28fa\u2867, \u283f\u283a\u280f\u280f\nAdvanced braille input\nThis feature allows you to enter any character from its HUC8 representation or its hexadecimal/decimal/octal/binary value. Moreover, it allows you to develop abbreviations. To use this function, enter the advanced input mode and then enter the desired pattern. Default gestures: NVDA+Windows+i or \u284a+space (on supported displays). Press the same gesture to exit this mode. Alternatively, an option allows you to automatically exit this mode after entering a single pattern. If you want to enter a character from its HUC8 representation, simply enter the HUC8 pattern. Since a HUC8 sequence must fit on 3 or 4 cells, the interpretation will be performed each time 3 or 4 dot combinations are entered. If you wish to enter a character from its hexadecimal, decimal, octal or binary value, do the following:\n. 1Enter \u283c\n. 2\nSpecify the basis as follows:\n\u2022 \u282d or \u2813: for a hexadecimal value\n\u2022 \u2819: for a decimal value\n\u2022 \u2815: for an octal value\n\u2022 \u2803: for a binary value\n. 3\nEnter the value of the character according to the previously selected basis.\n. 4Press Space to validate.\nFor abbreviations, you must first add them in the dialog box \u2014 Advanced input mode dictionary \u2014. Then, you just have to enter your abbreviation and press space to expand it. For example, you can define the following abbreviations: \"\u280e\u283a\" with \"sandwich\", \"\u280b\u281b\u280b\u2817\" to \"\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7\".\nHere are some examples of sequences to be entered for given characters:\nCharacter\nHUC8\nHexadecimal\nDecimal\nOctal\nBinary\n\ud83d\udc4d (thumbs up)\n\u28ed\u28a4\u2859\n\u282d1f44d or \u28131f44d\n\u2819128077\n\u2815372115\n\u280311111010001001101\n\ud83d\ude00 (grinning face)\n\u28ed\u2864\u28fa\n\u282d1f600 or \u28131f600\n\u2819128512\n\u2815373000\n\u280311111011000000000\n\ud83c\udf51 (peach)\n\u28ed\u2824\u2815\n\u282d1f351 or \u28131f351\n\u2819127825\n\u2815371521\n\u280311111001101010001\n\ud83c\udf0a (water wave)\n\u28ed\u2824\u283a\n\u282d1f30a or \u28131f30a\n\u2819127754\n\u2815371412\n\u280311111001100001010\nNote: the HUC6 input is currently not supported.\nOne-hand mode\nThis feature allows you to compose a cell in several steps. This can be activated in the general settings of the extension's preferences or on the fly using NVDA+Windows+h gesture by default (\u2842+space on supported displays). Three input methods are available.\nMethod #1: fill a cell in 2 stages on both sides\nWith this method, type the left side dots, then the right side dots. If one side is empty, type the dots correspondig to the opposite side twice, or type the dots corresponding to the non-empty side in 2 steps.\nFor example:\n\u2022 For \u281b: press dots 1-2 then dots 4-5.\n\u2022 For \u2803: press dots 1-2 then dots 1-2, or dot 1 then dot 2.\n\u2022 For \u2818: press 4-5 then 4-5, or dot 4 then dot 5.\nMethod #2: fill a cell in two stages on one side (Space = empty side)\nUsing this method, you can compose a cell with one hand, regardless of which side of the Braille keyboard you choose. The first step allows you to enter dots 1-2-3-7 and the second one 4-5-6-8. If one side is empty, press space. An empty cell will be obtained by pressing the space key twice.\nFor example:\n\u2022 For \u281b: press dots 1-2 then dots 1-2, or dots 4-5 then dots 4-5.\n\u2022 For \u2803: press dots 1-2 then space, or 4-5 then space.\n\u2022 For \u2818: press space then 1-2, or space then dots 4-5.\nMethod #3: fill a cell dots by dots (each dot is a toggle, press Space to validate the character)\nIn this mode, each dot is a toggle. You must press the space key as soon as the cell you have entered is the desired one to input the character. Thus, the more dots are contained in the cell, the more ways you have to enter the character.\nFor example, for \u281b, you can compose the cell in the following ways:\n\u2022 Dots 1-2, then dots 4-5, then space.\n\u2022 Dots 1-2-3, then dot 3 (to correct), then dots 4-5, then space.\n\u2022 Dot 1, then dots 2-4-5, then space.\n\u2022 Dots 1-2-4, then dot 5, then space.\n\u2022 Dot 2, then dot 1, then dot 5, then dot 4, and then space.\n\u2022 Etc.",

 "IndentNav": [

  "This add-on allows NVDA users to navigate by indentation level or offset of lines or paragraphs. In browsers it allows to quickly find paragraphs with the same offset from the left edge of the screen, such as first level comments in a hierarchical tree of comments. Also while editing source code in many programming languages, it allows to jump between the lines of the same indentation level, as well as quickly find lines with greater or lesser indentation level.\nUsage in browsers\nIndentNav can be used to navigate by offset from the left edge of the screen. IN particular, you can press NVDA+Alt+DownArrow or UpArrow to jump to the next or previous paragraph that has the same offset. For example, this can be useful when browsing hierarchical trees of comments (e.g. on reddit.com) to jump between first level comments and skipping all the higher level comments.\nStrictly speaking, IndentNav can be used in any application, for which NVDA provides a tree interceptor object.\nKeystrokes:\n\u2022 NVDA+Alt+UpArrow or DownArrow: Jump to previous or next paragraph with the same offset.\n\u2022 NVDA+alt+LeftArrow: Jump to previous paragraph with lesser offset.\n\u2022 NVDA+Alt+RightArrow: Jump to next paragraph with greater offset.\nUsage in text editors\nIndentNav can also be useful for editing source code in many programming languages. Languages like Python require the source code to be properly indented, while in many other programming languages it is strongly recommended. With IndentNav you can press NVDA+Alt+DownArrow or UpArrow to jump to next or previous line with the same indentation level. You can also press NVDA+Alt+LeftArrow to jump to a parent line, that is a previous line with lower indentation level. In Python you can easily find current function definition or class definition. You can also press NVDA+Alt+RightArrow to go to the first child of current line, that is next line with greater indentation level.\nIf your NVDA is set to express line indentation as tones, then IndentNav will quickly play the tones of all the skipped lines. Otherwise it will only crackle to roughly denote the number of skipped lines.\nKeystrokes:\n\u2022 NVDA+Alt+UpArrow or DownArrow: Jump to previous or next line with the same indentation level within the current indetnation block.\n\u2022 NVDA+Alt+Control+UpArrow or DownArrow: Force-jump to previous or next line with the same indentation level. This command will jump to other indentation blocks (such as other Python functions) if necessary.\n\u2022 NVDA+alt+LeftArrow: Jump to parent - that is previous line with lesser indentation level.\n\u2022 NVDA+Alt+RightArrow: Jump to first child - that is next line with greater indentation level within the same indentation block.",

If you are encountering any difficulties when using or installing this addon, please contact the author or use the \"Issues\" link on the Github project page.\nOfficial Github Repository\nAddon Features:\nSpeech support:\n\u2022 Dialogs and menus are properly reported;\n\u2022 Natural speech support for math formulas using the Lambda math engine, i.e. \"compound root 3 sep compound root 3 x plus 24, close compound root, minus 3 equals 0\";\n\u2022 implemented the Reading by character, words, lines and Say All;\n\u2022 Speaks when a block of text is selected or extended (using CTRL+B and SHIFT+CTRL+B);\n\u2022 Speaks when moving in the text editor using standard Windows commands and Lambda-specific commands;\n\u2022 Both Extended and Short speech modes are supported (you can select it using the Tools menu in Lambda);\n\u2022 Special dialogs like structure mode, calculator, and matrix window are now correctly reported and NVDA reads correctly when moving the cursor around or when new text is typed ;\n\u2022 Typing echo uses the Lambda text processor, so symbols and markers will be correctly reported.\nBraille support:\n\u2022 The addon installs (inside the user profile directory) and activates a custom braille table. This table may be different for different languages. Custom braille tables were made from ones in the Lambda plugin for JAWS (jbt file). Then symbols and markers are represented using the same dots patterns;\n\u2022 The addon creates an NVDA profile for a standard braille configuration. By this, the output is set to the custom braille table only when the Lambda application is active;\n\u2022 Dialogs and menus are properly reported in braille;\n\u2022 The content of the editor is correctly rendered in braille and the user is able to move using braille scrolling keys or cursor routing keys;\n\u2022 Starting from the addon version 1.1.0, there are two ways in which the text in the Lambda editor is rendered: \"Flat mode\" and \"non-Flat Mode\". When the \"Flat mode\" is on, NVDA will use the Display Model to retrieve information from the editor and to determine the caret position. This is specially beneficial when the user needs to move around on the screen, even in white spaces. When the \"Flat Mode\" is set to \"off\", text rendering on the braille display is more stable, since NVDA uses Windows API to retrieve it. However when the the caret is moved in white spaces next to the end of the line of text, the braille display does not follow the real cursor as long as a non-white space is added by the user.\nThe \"flat mode\" is active by default. You can toggle \"flat mode\" on or off by pressing NVDA+SHIFT+F.\nWe strongly recommend to disable the Flat Mode if you are using custom DPI in Windows (Custom sizing option), especially when you have screen settings with more than 96 dpi (larger than 100%).\n\u2022 The structure of dialog boxes is easier, repeated information has been removed;\n\u2022 The selection will be marked properly using dots 7 and 8, and marking is properly refreshed while standard Windows commands (SHIFT+ARROWS) or Lambda specific commands (CTRL+B, CTRL+SHIFT+B) are pressed.\nBefore starting to use this addon.\nThis addon creates an NVDA profile named \"lambda\" which is associated with the \"lambda.exe\" application. The profile automatically sets all braille options: the custom braille table, the focus tethering and flat mode settings.\nIf a previous profile with the same name is present in your system, the addon will not override it and you have to manually adjust your configuration profile.\nTo stave off this situation, if you have specific settings you'd like to preserve, you can use the \"Revert LAMBDA Profile Wizard\". The shortcut to start this tool is NVDA+alt+r (when focused in LAMBDA).\nAn easy option is also to delete old versions of the \"lambda\" profile after the installation of the addon. To do so, open the NVDA menu, select the \"Configuration profiles\" menu Item and press ENTER.\nIn the Configuration profiles dialog, you'll be able to locate and delete the \"lambda\" profile. The profile will be re-created the next time the Lambda application is started.\nDeleting the \"lambda\" profile should be an easy solution also when the addon runs into any problem. For instance, if the braille table is not properly set, instead of manually configuring the profile, you can simply delete it. The addon will create a new one the next time you'll load the Lambda editor.\nEach time the Lambda editor is started, this addon checks if a profile with the name \"lambda\" exists. If it doesn't, it automatically generates a profile with the following form:\nfilename : userData\\profiles\\lambda.ini :\n\n[braille]\n    readByParagraph = False\n    tetherTo = focus\n    translationTable = path-to-the-addon-brailleTable-dir\tableName\n\n[lambda]\n    brailleFlatMode = True\nWhere :\n\u2022 path-to-the-addon-brailleTable-dir : is the absolute path of the addon directory + \"\brailleTables\"\n\u2022 tableName : depends on the active NVDA language. Currently only the italian and Spanish braille tables, \"lambda-ita.utb\" and \"lambda-esp.utb\" respectively, is present.\nAddon Keyboard Shortcuts:\n\u2022 NVDA+Shift+f: Toggle braille flat mode on or off;\n\u2022 NVDA+alt+r: Open the \"Revert LAMBDA Profile Wizard\";\n\u2022 NVDA+d: Duplicate lines (use this instad of control+d).\nKnown issues:\nDue to a bug present in LAMBDA, the add-on provides an extra-logic that reports white spaces. This logic may fail in the following situations:\n\u2022 When words like \"space\", \"spazio\" \"Espacio\" etc. are inserted into the text, they may be reported by NVDA as the local NVDA language translation.\n\u2022 Blank lines are not reported by the LAMBDA speech engine. The user will hear the translation of the word \"space\" instead. This could be both a blank line or a line containing only the word \"space\".\nUseful tips\nThis is a set of tips that will help you on using the addon in a more eficient way.\n\u2022 Character-by-character reporting: Normally, when working with maths you would like NVDA to report things you're writing character by character. To do this, there are a couple of simple steps: ensure to have the focus on the LAMBDA's window or one of its variants (the six dots representation, for example); press NVDA+2 (number two) or navigate to NVDA menu>Preferences>Keyboard settings and check the box to Speak typed characters; go to LAMBDA>Options>Voice paramethers and ensure the checkbox \"echo\" is ON, otherwhise NVDA won't receive anything from the speech engine while you are typing. And done, NVDA will speak written characters, but don't worry, only in LAMBDA or its special windows, the settings for the rest of applications will be left as they were.\nAddon mailing list:\nTo report bugs, suggestions or if you want to contribute you can subscribe the Addon Group (in English).

With NVDA's log level set to debug, these events will be tracked, and for UIA notification event, a debug tone will be heard if notifications come from somewhere other than the currently active app. Events built into NVDA such as name change and controller for events are tracked from an add-on called Event Tracker.\n\u2022 When opening, closing, reordering (Windows 11), or switching between virtual desktops, NVDA will announce active virtual desktop name (desktop 2, for example).\n\u2022 NVDA will no longer announce Start menu size text when changing screen resolutions or orientation.\n\u2022 When arranging Start menu tiles or Action Center quick actions with Alt+Shift+arrow keys, NVDA will announce information on dragged items or new position of the dragged item.\n\u2022 Announcements such as volume/brightness changes in File Explorer and app update notifications from Microsoft Store can be suppressed by turning off Report Notifications in NVDA's object presentation settings.\nCalculator\n\u2022 NVDA will no longer announce graphing calculator screen message twice.\n\u2022 In Windows 10, history and memory list items are properly labeled.\nCortana\n\u2022 Textual responses from Cortana are announced in most situations.\n\u2022 NVDA will be silent when talking to Cortana via voice.\nMail\n\u2022 When reviewing items in messages list, you can now use table navigation commands to review message headers. Note that navigating between rows (messages) is not supported.\nMaps\n\u2022 NVDA plays location beep for map locations.\n\u2022 When using street side view and if \"use keyboard\" option is enabled, NVDA will announce street addresses as you use arrow keys to navigate the map.\nMicrosoft Solitaire Collection\n\u2022 NVDA will announce names of cards and card decks.\nModern keyboard\nThis includes emoji panel, clipboard history, dictation/voice typing, hardware input suggestions, and modern input method editors for certain languages. When viewing emojis, for best experience, enable Unicode Consortium setting from NVDA's speech settings and set symbol level to \"some\" or higher.

NVDA also supports updated input experience panel in Windows 11.\n\u2022 In Windows 10, when an emoji group (including kaomoji and symbols group) is selected, NVDA will no longer move navigator object to certain emojis.\n\u2022 Added support for updated input experience panel (combined emoji panel and clipboard history) in Windows 11.\n\u2022 In Windows 11, it is again possible to use the arrow keys to review emojis when emoji panel opens.\nNotepad\nThis refers to Windows 11 Notepad version 11 or later.\n\u2022 NVDA will announce status items such as line and column information when report status bar command (NVDA+End in desktop layout, NvDA+Shift+End in laptop layout) is performed.\n\u2022 NVDA will no longer announce entered text when pressing Enter key from the document.\nPeople\n\u2022 When searching for contacts, first suggestion will be announced, particularly if using recent app releases.\nSettings\n\u2022 Certain information such as Windows Update progress is reported automatically, including Storage sense/disk cleanup widget and errors from Windows Update.\n\u2022 Progress bar values and other information are no longer announced twice.\n\u2022 Odd control labels seen in certain Windows installations has been corrected.\n\u2022 NVDA will announce the name of the optional quality update control if present (download and install now link in Windows 10, download button in Windows 11).\n\u2022 In Windows 11, breadcrumb bar items are properly recognized.\nWeather\n\u2022 Tabs such as \"forecast\" and \"maps\" are recognized as proper tabs (patch by Derek Riemer).\n\u2022 When reading a forecast, use the left and right arrows to move between items. Use the up and down arrows to read the individual items. For example, pressing the right arrow might report \"Monday: 79 degrees, partly cloudy, ...\" pressing the down arrow will say \"Monday\" Then pressing it again will read the next item (Like the temperature).

 "NV Speech Player. A Klatt-based speech synthesis engine written in c++": [
  "2019.3 +",
  "NV Speech Player is a free and open-source prototype speech synthesizer that can be used by NVDA. It generates speech using Klatt synthesis, making it somewhat similar to speech synthesizers such as Dectalk and Eloquence.\nLicence and copyright\nNV Speech Player is Copyright (c) 2014 NV Speech Player contributors NV Speech Player is covered by the GNU General Public License (Version 2). You are free to share or change this software in any way you like as long as it is accompanied by the license and you make all source code available to anyone who wants it. This applies to both original and modified copies of this software, plus any derivative works. For further details, you can view the license online at: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html\nBackground\nThe 70s and 80s saw much research in speech synthesis. One of the most prominent synthesis models that appeared was a formant-frequency synthesis known as Klatt synthesis. Some well-known Klatt synthesizers are Dectalk and Eloquence. They are well suited for use by the blind as they are extremely responsive, their pronunciation is smooth and predictable, and they are small in memory footprint. However, research soon moved onto other forms of synthesis such as concatinative speech, as although this was slower, it was much closer to the human voice. This was an advantage for usage in mainstream applications such as GPS units or telephone systems, but not necessarily so much of an advantage to the blind, who tend to care more about responsiveness and predictability over prettiness.\nAlthough synthesizers such as Dectalk and Eloquence continued to be maintained and available for nearly 20 years, now they are becoming harder to get, with multiple companies saying that these, and their variants, have been end-of-lifed and will not be updated anymore.\nConcatinative synthesis is now starting to show promise as a replacement as the responsiveness and smoothness is improving. However, most if not all of the acceptable quality synthesizers are commercial and are rather expensive.\nBoth Dectalk and Eloquence were closed-source commercial products themselves. However, there is a substantial amount of source code and research material on Klatt synthesis available to the community. NV Speech Player tries to take advantage of this by being a modern prototype of a Klatt synthesizer, in the hopes to either be a replacement for synthesizers like Dectalk or Eloquence, or at least restart research and conversation around this synthesis method.\nThe eSpeak synthesizer, itself a free and open-source product has proved well as a replacement to a certain number of people in the community, but many people who hear it are extremely quick to point out its \"metallic\" sound and cannot seem to continue to use it. Although the authors of NV Speech Player still prefer eSpeak as their synthesizer of choice, they would still hope to try and understand better this strange resistance to eSpeak which may have something to do with eSpeak's spectral frequency synthesis verses Klatt synthesis. It may also have to do with the fact that consonants are also gathered from recorded speech and can therefore be perceived as being injected into the speech stream.\nImplementation\nThe synthesis engine itself is written in C++ using modern idioms, but closely following the implementation of klsyn-88, found at http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/phonlab/resources/\neSpeak is used to parse text into phonemes represented in IPA, making use of existing eSpeak dictionary processing. eSpeak can be found at: http://espeak.sourceforge.net/\nThe Klatt formant data for each individual phoneme was collected mostly from a project called PyKlatt: http://code.google.com/p/pyklatt/ However it has been further tweaked based on testing and matching with eSpeak's own data.\nThe rules for phoneme lengths, gaps, speed and intonation have been coded by hand in Python, though eSpeak's own intonation data was tried to be copied as much as possible.\nBuilding NV Speech Player\nYou will need: - Python 3.7: http://www.python.org - SCons 3: http://www.scons.org/ - Visual Studio 2019 Community\nTo build: run scons\nAfter building, there will be a nvSpeechPlayer_xxx.nvda-addon file in the root directory, where xxx is the git revision or hardcoded version number. Installing this add-on into NVDA will allow you to use the Speech Player synthesizer in NVDA. Note everything you need is in the add-on, no extra dlls or files need to be copied.",

The plugin saves the specified strings and bookmarks to files whose name is based on the title and URL of the current document. This addon is based on SpecificSearch and Bookmark&Search, developed by the same author. You should uninstall them to use this one, since they have common keystrokes and features.\nKey Commands:\n\u2022 control+shift+NVDA+f: Opens a dialog with an edit box that shows the last saved search; in this dialog you can also select the previously saved searches from a combo box or remove the selected string from the history using a checkbox. You can choose if the text contained in the edit box will be added to the history of your saved texts. Finally, choose an action from the next group of radio buttons (between Search next, Search previous or Don't search), and specify if NVDA will make a case sensitive search.

 "instantTranslate": [
  "unknown",
  "This add-on is used to translate selected and/or clipboard text from one language to another. This is done using the Google Translate service.\nConfiguring languages\nTo configure source, target and in case swap language, go to: NVDA Menu >> Preferences >> Instant Translate Settings.\nThere are two comboboxes labeled \"Source language\" and \"Target language\", and a checkbox to decide if it must copy the translation to clipboard.\nIn addition, if you selected auto option (the first choice) from \"Source language\" combobox, there are also a combobox labeled \"Language for swapping\" and a checkbox about the auto-swap.\nThe meaning of two first comboboxes and checkbox for copy is clear, but some words about the rest are necessary. Remember always that the explanations below assume the source language set on the auto option.\nThe \"Language for swapping\" combobox is useful when you swap via script (see below) the source and target language; in fact, a target language set on the auto option has no sense, so the addon sets it to value of combobox above.\nSo, imagine this situation: you usually translate into English (your main language), but sometimes (for example, when you write a document) you need to translate into Italian (your second language, suppose); you can set \"Language for swapping\" combobox to Italian, so you will translate from English to Italian without accessing directly to the addon settings. Obviously this function has a major or minor utility according to your more frequent needs.\nNow, the auto-swap checkbox: it appears if and only if you set the auto option in \"Source language\" combobox, and is directly connected with \"Language for swapping\" combobox. If you activate it, then the addon tries to commute automatically from your source and target configuration to a configuration where target becomes the source language, and language selected in \"Language for swapping\" combobox is the new target language; extremely useful if the source language of the text you want translate is the target language.\nA simple example: take again in mind the situation imagined previously; if you translate a text in a language different from English, there is no problem, you get the correct translation in English. But if you need to translate a text from English, normally you get a translation into English identical to original text, and this is a bit useless. Thanks to auto-swap function, however, assuming that you want to know how your text sounds into Italian, the addon commutes automatically the target language to Italian, so it returns a valid translation.\nAnyway, this is a temporary configuration; if this option has no effect (it's experimental), try to commute manually to a stable configuration, using the gesture for swapping described below. It's experimental because in some situations (with short texts, typically), Google does not recognize the real source language correctly, and you have to swap languages manually via script, so to force the source language to be the previous target language (English in our example).\nAt least, in the speech settings parameters dialog (NVDA Menu >> Preferences >> Speech), you may want to check the \"Automatic language switching (when supported)\" option. This way, if you are using a multi-lingual synthesizer, the translation will be announced using the target language voice of the synthesizer.\nUsing\nYou can use this add-on in three ways:\n1. Select some text using selection commands (shift with arrow keys, for example) and press associated key to translate. translation result will be read with synthesizer which you are using.\n2. You can also translate text from the Clipboard.\n3. Press the dedicated shortcut key to translate the last spoken text.\nShortcuts\nAll following commands must be pressed after modifier key \"NVDA+Shift+t\":\n\u2022 T: Translate selected text,\n\u2022 Shift+t: translate text from the Clipboard,\n\u2022 S: swap source and target languages,\n\u2022 A: announce current configuration,\n\u2022 C: copy last result to clipboard,\n\u2022 I: identify the language of selected text,\n\u2022 L: translate the last spoken text,\n\u2022 O: open translation settings dialog\n\u2022 H: announces all available layered commands.",
